# libft
Project "Libft" from the school 42 (Paris)

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to recreate the C standard library (libc) so that we can use it in any of our next projects,
since we are not allowed to use it in the first place.

### Build
Simply run ```make``` in a terminal to build the library called ```libft.a```
If you want to use it in a project just copy the .a file and include it with the ```-lft``` flag in gcc.

### TODO:
[ ] Implements qsort
